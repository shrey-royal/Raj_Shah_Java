Polymorphism: The ability to use same thing in many ways.

Poly means Many and Morph means Forms. So, Polymorphism means many forms.

inheritance: use same method but can't create new method in child class.
polymorphism: use the method and even modify/change that method based on the needs of the child class.

Concepts of Polymorphism:

1. Method Overloading
2. Method Overriding
3. Covariant Return Type (same method but different return type)
4. super keyword
5. Instance Initializer Block
6. Final keyword (const)
7. Runtime Polymorphism
8. Dynamic Binding
9. instanceof Operator
